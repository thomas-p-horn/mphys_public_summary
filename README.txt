An interactive website to teach the vocabulary surrounding AGN and their basic physics.

This repo is my submission for the "public summary" section of my master's project.
Its goal is to summarise the topic of my project for a non-specialist audience.

Note: Some .svg manipulation seems to break when running the site locally,
so diagram-based questions are effectively impossible unless you already know the answer.
Usability through GitHub Pages (link above) is unaffected.
